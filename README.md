# Overview

This repository is for holding code challenges that I use to learn OCaml. I will be journaling a bit to reflect on my progress and keep organized for later review. Each folder will have a `.md` for information about the problem and my process to solve it, and a `.ml` with the solution code. My goal is to contribute about 3 times a week here, and eventually be able to solve most medium level problems with OCaml.
